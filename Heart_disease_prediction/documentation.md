Heart Diseases and Cardiovascular Conditions are one of the leading causes of death in many countries of the world, but many of these conditions can be improved or even prevented by putting in place some changes in our daily lives. In this context having early indication of possible future Cardiovascular Problems plays a crucial role, particularly when medical data are largely available. For this work, we will use a publicly available dataset of 11 features and 918 observations to predict whether a given patient is likely to develop some heart disease, making use of several well known techniques – such as feature scaling and dimensionality reduction – and models – such as Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors.

### What's in here?
- the Jupiter Notebook with all the code and comments of the project `main.ipynb`
- the report with the description and results `report.pdf`

### Dataset
The dataset we will use was prepared and made available by the user `fedesoriano` on Kaggle, see: www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction
This dataset contains 12 characteristics of 918 patients selected from four different institutions around the world. Each of the characteristics represents a particular piece of medical information, with the twelfth being the key one: it indicates whether or not a given patient actually developed heart disease

### Disclamair
This project was part of a course of Fundamentals of Data Science at Sapienza University of Rome held by Prof. F. Galasso. This project was done in collaboration with Edoardo Loru and Alessia Sgrigna.
